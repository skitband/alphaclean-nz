                                            We are a small team based out of Wellington City with a massive ambition to grow and provide a high standard of cleaning for all commercial facilities throughout our beautiful country.
Why should you choose us instead of other cleaning companies? With one of our directors serving over 10 years in the New Zealand Defence Force we have taken many of their cleaning protocols and applied it to our methods. Each site that we secure we go around with the facility managers and gain a detailed list of everything that they want cleaned. From there we create a tailor made cleaning checklist for each site. 
The cleaners will then be provided with a laminated sheet of everything that needs to be cleaned. Ensuring they finish everything on that list to the best of their ability. If the managers request so one of our staff members will walk around your facility the following day to inspect the cleaning ensuring that all parties are satisfied with the cleaning.
Alpha Clean believes in improving our practices continuously and creating an enjoyable relationship with our clients
Our agents are proud of their reputation for delivering the best possible high-quality cleaning results.
